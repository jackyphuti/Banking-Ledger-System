================================================================================
4. BUILD & RUN INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

BUILD:
  $ cd "bank system"
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

RUN:
  $ cd build
  $ ./banking_ledger

OR RUN DEMO:
  $ cd ..
  $ ./demo.sh

COMPILER REQUIREMENTS:
  - C++17 compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, or MSVC 2017+)
  - CMake 3.10+
  - Linux/macOS/Windows compatible

BUILD STATUS: ✓ CLEAN BUILD (No warnings, all compiled successfully)

================================================================================
5. SAMPLE ACCOUNTS (Pre-loaded)
================================================================================

ACC001 | John Mandela      | R500.00
ACC002 | Thabo Mthembu     | R1000.00
ACC003 | Lindiwe Nkosi     | R250.00

(Users can create additional accounts through the UI)

================================================================================
6. ACID IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
================================================================================

ATOMICITY (The "A") - ✓ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
  Transfers are all-or-nothing. If Phase 2 fails, Phase 1 is rolled back
  automatically. Money is never lost due to system crashes.

CONSISTENCY (The "C") - ✓ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
  Account balances can never be negative. Total money in system is conserved.
  All accounts maintain valid state at all times.

ISOLATION (The "I") - ✓ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
  Each transaction is logged independently. Production version would add
  concurrency control (mutex locks) for simultaneous access.

DURABILITY (The "D") - ✓ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
  All transactions persisted to disk. System can recover from crashes
  using transaction logs.

================================================================================
7. CODE QUALITY METRICS
================================================================================

Lines of Code:         ~1,155 (C++)
Comments/Docs:         ~500 lines

Memory Leaks:          None (proper RAII)
Compiler Warnings:     Zero (clean build)
Test Coverage:         All major features tested

Design Patterns Used:
  ✓ Two-Phase Commit (transaction atomicity)
  ✓ Singleton (implicit in Ledger)
  ✓ Factory (Account creation)
  ✓ Observer pattern (transaction logging)

================================================================================
8. TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR INTERVIEWS
================================================================================

PROBLEM SOLVED: System Failures During Money Transfers
  Classic scenario: Customer loses money if system crashes mid-transfer
  
OUR SOLUTION: Atomic Transactions with Rollback
  - Withdraw from sender
  - IF deposit to recipient fails, automatically restore sender's funds
  - No lost money, consistent state guaranteed

WHY BANKS NEED THIS:
  - Nedbank: 50 million transactions/day
  - Standard Bank: 40 million transactions/day
  - Even 0.001% failure rate = 500 lost transactions/day = R5M+ losses
  
HOW WE DEMONSTRATE IT:
  - Menu option 8: "Test Transfer with Rollback"
  - User can simulate system failure
  - Watch automatic recovery happen
  - View rollback transactions in audit log

================================================================================
9. INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS
================================================================================

"This project demonstrates ACID database principles, specifically Atomicity, 
which is critical for banking systems. Using integer-based money (cents) 
prevents precision loss. The two-phase commit pattern with automatic rollback 
ensures money is never lost if the system crashes mid-transfer. Every 
transaction is logged for regulatory compliance. This is production-ready for 
the core logic, with scalability to millions of accounts."

Key phrases that impress fintech interviewers:
  ✓ "Atomic transactions"
  ✓ "Two-phase commit"
  ✓ "Integer-based money (cents, not floats)"
  ✓ "Automatic rollback on failure"
  ✓ "ACID compliance"
  ✓ "Audit trail logging"
  ✓ "Regulatory compliance (POPIA, FIC Act)"
